    "Canopy fuel was constructed using tree locations and attributes derived from the\n",
    "ALS data collected for the burn plot. The geographic locations of the trees were\n",
    "constructed using a tree detection algorithm designed to find treetops within the\n",
    "canopy height model (CHM).  The crowns were delineated using Silva 2016 algorithm\n",
    "and converted into polygons. The following tree attributes were calculated for\n",
    "each polygon: crown height, height to live crown (htlc), and crown radius.  The \n",
    "tree attributes from the crown polygon were joined with the tree locations using \n",
    "a spatial join for all intersecting features. Using the Linn et al. 2005 fuel building \n",
    "algorithm, each tree was converted into a three-dimensional axisymmetric shape \n",
    "bound to the top and bottom by two paraboloids to represent an idealized tree. Fine \n",
    "fuels were added to each tree shape, with fuel declining toward the center of the \n",
    "trunk and toward the bottom of the canopy. Fuel from the trees was subsequently \n",
    "split between voxels based on how it overlapped with the three-dimensional voxel \n",
    "array. \n",
    "Surface fuel was constructed by approximating the placement of litter and grass \n",
    "fuels beneath the canopy. The Linn et al. 2005 algorithm assumes that grass concentrations \n",
    "fall beneath the canopy and that litter load increases based on the amount of \n",
    "canopy above it. Clip plot data from the site was used to calculate the average \n",
    "fuel loads for grass and litter fuel.  Average litter fuel loading was calculated \n",
    "by taking the average sum of the dead woody litter, pine needle, and conifer litter \n",
    "from each clip plot, and average grass fuel loading was calculated by taking the \n",
    "average the surface fuel values categorized as other, which consisted of grasses, \n",

    "ignitions. The times for the drip torch ignition were determined using the start and \n",
    "stop time attributes for each line.  It was assumed that each line was ignited at a \n",
